        <h1>Disclaimer</h1>
        <p>
            As mentioned in the process book, evaluating major search trends is not an easy process
            <br> something can be tagged one way but have a different meaning than inteded.
            <br> Filters were applied to alleviate this, but it still may not be perfect. This project
            <br> wants to aknowledge this but still recognize the larger trends going on.
        <br>
