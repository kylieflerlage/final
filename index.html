        <p>Over the years water bottles have become more and more of a trend and even form of expression. 
            <br>Here I want to compare of the trend of the “most searched water bottle” between states as well as specific brands. 
            <br>These comparisons are limited to the USA and trends of the past 5 years
        <br>
